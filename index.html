        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>
        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
      </li>
    </ul>

        To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
      </p>
      <code>
        function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
greetMe("World");
      </code>

    <p>
      You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
    </p>
        <p>
          You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

      You can declare a variable in three ways:

    </p>
    <p>
      With the keyword var. For example,
    </p>
    <code>
      var x = 42.
    </code>
        <p>
          This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
        </p>
        <p>
          By simply assigning it a value. For example,
        </p>
        <code>
          x = 42.
        </code>
        <p>
          This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the keyword let. For example
        </p>
        <code>
           let y = 13.
        </code>
        <p>
          This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.
        </p>

      <h1>Variable Scope</h1>
    </header>
    <article>
    <p>
      When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.
    </p>
    <code>
      if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
    </code>
      <p>
        This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
      </p>
      <code>
        if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
      </code>
